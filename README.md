## Search Select Usage

```js
import { SearchSelect } from 'vue3-search-select'
```

```css
import "vue3-search-select/Vue-Search-Select.css";
```

```js
 <SearchSelect
    :data="pseudoEmployeeData"
    placeholderName="Employee" // optional
    displayKey="firstName lastName - employeeId"
    :selectMax="2" // optional
    v-model="employee"
    primaryKey="employeeId"
    :defaultValue="['emp-0001']" // optional
  />
```

## Dynamic Multi Select

The DynamicMultiSelect component is packed with advanced functionality, allowing users to select multiple options from a dynamic list with ease and flexibility.

üöÄ Key Features

üéõÔ∏è Slot Manipulation
Customize component slots to control how each item selected will be displayed, allowing for unique visual arrangements.

üîç Show Results on Search (optional)
Can display search results when users begin typing, keeping the interface clean and focused until needed.

üóÇÔ∏è Custom Display Order
Easily reorder options to prioritize frequently selected or high-importance items at the top of the list.

üîë Primary Key Tracking
Each item is uniquely identified by a primary key, ensuring consistent data handling and accurate selections.

üî¢ Conditional Count Display
Apply conditions to dynamically control the visibility of options based on specific counts, improving list relevance.

üîç Multi-Select Search
Built-in search functionality enables users to filter multiple selections, making large lists more manageable.

üñºÔ∏è Image Prefix for Options
Add an image prefix to each list option, creating a visually rich experience and making options more recognizable.

‚≠ê Default Value Selection
Set default values to highlight recommended or commonly selected options, enhancing the user experience from the start.

üö´ Auto-Close on Maximum Selection
Automatically close the dropdown when the maximum number of selections is reached, ensuring users know their selection limit.

üîç Show on Search
Only show dropdown options after the user starts typing, instead of displaying all options immediately. Useful when the list is long or fetched from an external source.

üåê Search with API
Trigger an API call when the user types in the input field, instead of filtering a local array. Ideal for real-time search through a remote database.

‚è±Ô∏è Debounce API Call By
Wait a specified number of milliseconds after the user stops typing before making the API call. Helps reduce the number of requests when users type quickly.

```js
import { DynamicMultiSelect } from 'vue3-search-select'
```

```css
import "vue3-search-select/Vue-Search-Select.css";
```

```js
  <DynamicMultiSelect
    v-model="anotherEmploye"
    :data="pseudoEmployeeData"
    display-key="firstName lastName - employeeId"
    primary-key="employeeId"
    imgPrefix="src" // (optional) to add prefix to the list for each item, src is the key in the object of each array
    :select-max="3" // optional
    :defaultValue="['APN999000', 'APN0001']" // optional
    :closeAfterMax="true" // optional
  >
    <template #listClassPrefix="{ item }"> // optional slot manipulation to add prefix to each item in a list
      <div :class="item.tag === 'tech' ? 'red-circle' : 'blue-circle'"></div>
    </template>
    <template #dynamicAction="{ item }">
      {{ fullNameList(item) }}
    </template>
  </DynamicMultiSelect>

  const fullNameList = (item: Person[]) => { // show fullname after the picked
    let allItems = item?.map((obj) => `${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`).join(', ')
    return allItems
  }
```

**Another shiny use case is API - Show On Search**
It helps when you want to keep the full list hidden by default and only show results based on what the user is actively searching for.

```js
  <DynamicMultiSelect
    v-model="selectedUsers"
    :data="searchResults"
    displayKey="name"
    primaryKey="id"
    :showOnSearch="true" // important for this implementation
    :searchApi="searchUsersApi" // your function where the api is being called will be here
    :selectMax="5"
    :debounceApiCallBy="1500" // by default this debounce is set to 1 second but it is adjustable
  />

  const selectedUsers = ref([])
  const searchResults = ref([])

  // searchUsersApi takes a search term as a parameter,
  // the searchApi prop will take a function like this,
  // call it and pass the search string to the parameter,
  const searchUsersApi = async (searchTerm: string) => {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/search/repositories?q=${searchTerm}`)
    const data = await response.json()
    return (searchResults.value = data.items)
  }
```

## Explanations of All Props

- **data**: This is where you pass your data to, it houses/consumes your data.

- **placeholderName**: This is what is attached to the count of the things you will pick in the input box e.g 2 Employee Selected. Take note of the "**Employee** that was passed to the component". You can change it to whatever you want. This is optional prop. If you exclude the placeholderName prop, once you pick items what will show in the input will be e.g "1 item selected"

- **displayKey**: This is what will be displayed from the data you are passing. You can decide to add a **separator**. From the example component you can decide to use

```js
firstName lastName // coming from the api/json you are consuing
```

OR

```js
firstName lastName | employeeId // coming from the api/json you are consuing
```

- **selectMax**: **This is an optional prop**, if you want to pick from the list inifintely, you can take off the **selectMax** prop from the component. But if you have need to cap the number of items to be picked from the list then add the **selectMax** prop. Once it is met, all other items will be disabled.

- **v-model**: of course we know what v-model is.

- **primaryKey**: Primary key is an essential part of this component, because it tells the component to keep track of a particular **key** in the array that is being passed to it and this is what **v-model** will be keep track of. If your primary key is employeeId, as you keeping picking from the list, it will keep adding employeeId to **v-model** as an array e.g [00000, 22222, 44444].

- **defaultValue**: **This is an optional prop**. This is the prop you will use if you need to pass default value that matches the primaryKey. E.g in an edit page, you will certainly be passing default value.

- **imgPrefix**: **This is an optional prop for Dynamic Multi Select**. All that is needed is to reference key in the object from the data you are sending to the dynamic multiselect. The key can be _src_, _image_, _link_ etc. What is important is that, **it must be an image**.

- **slots**: Only two slots are available for **Dyamic Multi Select** and they are:

1. _List Prefix_: You can add a prefix to the list being displayed in the drop down, e.g you want to add a blue circle/banner to the prefix of each item if their tag is tech and blue circle for others. **NOTE**: To use this slot, make sure the **imgPrefix is taken off the component because it will take precedence over this list class prefix prop**.

_EXAMPLE_

```js
  <template #listClassPrefix="{ item }">
    <div :class="item.tag === 'tech' ? 'red-circle' : 'blue-circle'"></div>
  </template>
```

2. _Dynamic Action_: This is the slot you can use to manipulate the display of the items you have picked. By using this slot you can add only images to slot, show the name of items piacked, add banners etc. All you need to do make use of the _item_ that passed down to the slot template.

_EXAMPLE_

```js
  <template #dynamicAction="{ item }">
    {{ fullNameList(item) }}
  </template>

  const fullNameList = (item: Person[]) => { // show fullname after the picked
    let allItems = item?.map((obj) => `${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`).join(', ')
    return allItems
  }
```

- **closeAfterMax**: If you added selectMax to any of the components. Once there is a _closeAfterMax_ is added to your component, it will close the selection dropdown once **selectMax** is true.
