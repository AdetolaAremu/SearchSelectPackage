## Explanations of All Props

- **data**: This is where you pass your data to, it houses/consumes your data.

- **placeholderName**: This is what is attached to the count of the things you will pick in the input box e.g 2 Employee Selected. Take note of the "**Employee** that was passed to the component". You can change it to whatever you want. This is optional prop. If you exclude the placeholderName prop, once you pick items what will show in the input will be e.g "1 item selected"

- **displayKey**: This is what will be displayed from the data you are passing. You can decide to add a **separator**. From the example component you can decide to use

```js
firstName lastName // coming from the api/json you are consuing
```

OR

```js
firstName lastName | employeeId // coming from the api/json you are consuing
```

- **selectMax**: **This is an optional prop**, if you want to pick from the list inifintely, you can take off the **selectMax** prop from the component. But if you have need to cap the number of items to be picked from the list then add the **selectMax** prop. Once it is met, all other items will be disabled.

- **v-model**: of course we know what v-model is.

- **primaryKey**: Primary key is an essential part of this component, because it tells the component to keep track of a particular **key** in the array that is being passed to it and this is what **v-model** will be keep track of. If your primary key is employeeId, as you keeping picking from the list, it will keep adding employeeId to **v-model** as an array e.g [00000, 22222, 44444].

- **defaultValue**: **This is an optional prop**. This is the prop you will use if you need to pass default value that matches the primaryKey. E.g in an edit page, you will certainly be passing default value.

- **imgPrefix**: **This is an optional prop for Dynamic Multi Select**. All that is needed is to reference key in the object from the data you are sending to the dynamic multiselect. The key can be _src_, _image_, _link_ etc. What is important is that, **it must be an image**.

- **slots**: Only two slots are available for **Dyamic Multi Select** and they are:

1. _List Prefix_: You can add a prefix to the list being displayed in the drop down, e.g you want to add a blue circle/banner to the prefix of each item if their tag is tech and blue circle for others. **NOTE**: To use this slot, make sure the **imgPrefix is taken off the component because it will take precedence over this list class prefix prop**.

_EXAMPLE_

```js
  <template #listClassPrefix="{ item }">
    <div :class="item.tag === 'tech' ? 'red-circle' : 'blue-circle'"></div>
  </template>
```

2. _Dynamic Action_: This is the slot you can use to manipulate the display of the items you have picked. By using this slot you can add only images to slot, show the name of items piacked, add banners etc. All you need to do make use of the _item_ that passed down to the slot template.

_EXAMPLE_

```js
  <template #dynamicAction="{ item }">
    {{ fullNameList(item) }}
  </template>

  const fullNameList = (item: Person[]) => { // show fullname after the picked
    let allItems = item?.map((obj) => `${obj.firstName} ${obj.lastName}`).join(', ')
    return allItems
  }
```

- **closeAfterMax**: If you added selectMax to any of the components. Once there is a _closeAfterMax_ is added to your component, it will close the selection dropdown once **selectMax** is true.
